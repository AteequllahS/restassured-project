## API - DB Validation
Just like we did on UI - DB validation for example the dashboard number in library app :
we got expected result from database and compare that with the UI Dashboard number,

We can do similar type of test for API-DB validation.
The objective is the response that coming from the api request is matching actual data in the database.

Sometime , when the api is created , it is not actually connected to the real database to prototype the
response with some dummy data so UI can display those data by calling the api that return dummy data.
When it's actually connected to the database, we can make sure the data is actually coming from database
rather than dummy data as response.

2. Add your db utility class from previous project under this project utility package
3. Create a class called API_DB_Test
4. Create a test class and try out your connection
5. Run Simple Query

SELECT * FROM REGIONS

6. Print it out.
