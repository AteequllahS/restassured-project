    https://www.getpostman.com/collections/4ea3cf2262b1b19a6d29

    it is for historical formula one race information
    in this particular api, it decided to give you xml by default for response type
    and in this particular api, it decided to give you json if you add.json at the end of url

    for example:
    http://ergast.com/api/f1/drivers  --> return xml
    http://ergast.com/api/f1/drivers.json --> return json

    our objective is to practice json path to find the values in json result
    also practice de-serialization by converting single driver json to POJO
    practice converting driver json array into List<Driver>
